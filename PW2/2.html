		<h1>Apply paints with the color picker</h1>
		<p>Paints can be colors, gradients, or images. The Color picker allows you to apply paints to text layers, strokes and other vector objects.
		When you select a layer or object, you can access the Color picker from the Fill or Stroke section of the Properties Panel.
		When you select more than one layer or object, you can access the Color picker from the Selection colors section instead.</p>
